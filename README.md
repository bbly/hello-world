# hello-world
I'm trying to get an idea of how version control works for a book I'm working on called _We Descend_. My friend Mark Emmer is going to talk with me today about his work with SNOBOL, a text-processing program he helped develop in the 1980s, and still curates.
_We Descend_ is about an archive of writings by numerous authors, gathered and transmitted over a span of many generations. 
Some of these writings exist in multiple copies, and there may be significant differences between instances; I'd like to gain some experience with a method of keeping track of these differences.
